# Win-X-Menu
I accidently deleted the Folder for PowerShell in the Win + X Menu... I got rid of the Bad Links.

I downloaded the Win X Editor but even if I deleted the PowerShell Links
They Would Still Be Listed...

I had to remove Group 2 and Group 3 to make PowerShell ( Both Links ) Not Show Up.
They were showing up as Command Prompt Titles..

I took the info from the Desktop.ini of group 2 and group 3
and added them to the Desktop.ini of group 1

Then using the Win X Editor I could add New Items and everything was in group 1
I added a photo... of the Menu I edited.

group 1 can be found  C:\Users\Admin\AppData\Local\Microsoft\Windows\WinX\group1
with all the links. I moved group2 and group3 to group1 and modified the the desktop.ini
